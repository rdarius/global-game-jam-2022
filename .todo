if I have time left:
    ☐ once player reached the top, show winner's name to all players in that server and save their name in leaderboards next to button of that server
    ☐ kawaii girl congatulates you when you reach the top
    ☐ upgrade slimes to bigger and cuter creatures (maybe shrimps)
    ☐ add background music from GDrive? (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZT_PQ4y0_KFQoQ34KN0AFEyaZ40WPX7L)
